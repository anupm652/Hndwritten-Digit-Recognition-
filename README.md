Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project uses Python and TensorFlow to train and test the model.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The dataset can be downloaded using the tensorflow.keras.datasets module.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project can be extended to include more advanced models and techniques to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The model can be used for various applications such as digit recognition in postal addresses, bank checks, and more.
